# Our Apartment

We hope you feel completely at home! Here are a few tips to make things extra comfortable:

## 🧑‍🍳 Kitchen and pantry 🍳

### 🍴 Kitchenware 🥛

All kitchen items are in the pantry, and you're welcome to use everything.
Just one request: please avoid putting any Teflon and wooden items in the dishwasher.

### 🍞 Foodstuff 🍯

Feel free to enjoy our coffee, tea, and rice and other basic ingredients.
Just make yourself at home!

### 🗑️ Trash ♻️

Please collect communal trash separately from recyclable plastic and paper.
Please take out the trash, plastic, and paper to the container in front of the building.

## 🧺 Laundry 🧢

### 👕 Washing clothes 👖

Laundry Supplies: Detergents and drying racks are in the pantry.
Leave the washing machine door and detergent drawer open after use,
and skip fabric softener (use a splash of vinegar instead).

## 🚿 Bathroom and toilet 🚽

Bathroom Drain:  If it clogs, lift the rack and clear any hair.

Toilet: Finding the light switch and turning on the tap is tricky. We know, sorry!

- 💡 Light switch: Inside, on the right, above the shelf.
- 🚰 Tap/faucet: Twist the end of the tap itself.

## 🚴‍♀️ Bicycles 🚴‍♂️

Feel free to use our bikes!
Just remember to bring them back up to the apartment afterward,
as there's a tendency for bikes to "disappear" in the Netherlands. 😄

## 🚭 No smoking 🚭

Smoking is not allowed.
