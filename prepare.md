# Prepare for your stay

## 🌦️ Weather 🍃

The weather in the Netherlands can be unpredictable and changes frequently,
so we recommend dressing in layers and packing a quality raincoat.
An umbrella isn't ideal due to the frequent wind and the crowds in the city center.

## 🎟️ Museum tickets 🏛️

Popular museums like the *van Gogh* or the Anne Frank House sell out days or even weeks in advance.
Buy your tickets at least one or two weeks in advance.

## 📱 Apps and websites 🧑‍💻

We recommend downloading and using these apps or checking these websites:

- **[Rick Steves Audio Europe](https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-listen/audio/audio-europe)**:
A really good, informative, and free podcast and guided audio tour app from a guy who's books we also recommend.
You'll find excellent podcasts covering Dutch history, society, and traditions, as well as the unique polder system.

or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ricksteves.audioeurope&hl=en).

- **[9292 travel planner](https://www.9292.nl/en/)**:
The best website and app for planning trips with public transport in the Netherlands or Amsterdam.
(Although Google Maps is also fine for just planning.)
Download for [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/9292/id556557690)
or [Android](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.negentwee).

- **[Organic Maps](https://organicmaps.app/)**:
Google Maps does not work well for planning bicycle routes because it takes you along busy roads instead of bike paths.
We recommend the Organic Maps instead. It also has offline maps features.
Download for [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/app/organic-maps/id1567437057)
or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.organicmaps&hl=en).

- **[Babonbo](https://www.babonbo.com/en/search/amsterdam/NL)** is a website for renting baby gear.
