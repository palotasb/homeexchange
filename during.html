<h1>During your stay</h1>

<main>

<p>We hope you feel completely at home! Here are a few tips to make things extra comfortable:</p>

<h2>Living room</h2>

<h3>Candles</h3>
<p>You'll find candles and a lighter in the white box in the TV stand.</p>

<h3>Aromatherapy</h3>
<p>
In the “Toms” box, also on the TV stand, there are aromatherapy oils for use with the diffuser.
Add 1 dl of water with 2-3 drops of oil (and to keep it fresh, it's best to clean it before or after each use).
</p>

<h2>Kitchen</h2>
<h3>Kitchenware</h3>
<p>
All kitchen items are in the pantry, and you're welcome to use everything.
Just one request: please avoid putting any Teflon and wooden items in the dishwasher.
</p>
<h3>Trash</h3>
<p>
TODO
</p>

<h2>Pantry and laundry</h2>
<h3>Washing clothes</h3>
<p>
Laundry Supplies: Detergents and drying racks are in the pantry.
Leave the washing machine door and detergent drawer open after use,
and skip fabric softener (use a splash of vinegar instead).
</p>

<h2>Bathroom and toilet</h2>
<p>Bathroom Drain:  If it clogs, lift the rack and clear any hair.</p>

<h2>🚴‍♀️ Bycicles 🚴‍♂️</h2>
<p>
Feel free to use our bikes!
Just remember to bring them back up to the apartment afterward,
as there's a tendency for bikes to “disappear” in the Netherlands. 😄
</p>

<h2>🚭 Smoking</h2>

<p>Smoking is not allowed.</p>
