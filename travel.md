## 🚃 Public transport 🚋

Public transport in the Netherlands is quite efficient.
You can conveniently check in and out using your debit card.
For planning your journey and purchasing tickets, you can you the 9292 application is highly recommended as well.

## 🚴‍♂️ Biking 🚴‍♀️

If you prefer to get around by bike, we recommend using Organic Maps instead of Google Maps—    it provides better bike route information.

Amsterdam bikers can be a bit crazy!
If you don't feel comfortable biking in the city,
you can easily take the metro to the city center—it's only a 25-minute ride.

## 👼 Traveling with little ones? 🧸

We don't have any equipment for little kids available.
We recommend checking out [Babonbo](https://www.babonbo.com/en/search/amsterdam/NL)
for renting strollers, toys, or any other essentials you may need during your stay.

## 🚗 Car rental and driving 🚓

We only really recommend using or renting a car if you're more than 3 people visiting another city
and taking a train would be too expensive.
Don't go to Amsterdam with a car, it's a hassle.

If you need to rent a car, we can recommend these companies.

- [MyWheels](https://mywheels.nl/en)
is a car sharing app with cars all around Amsterdam.
You choose a nearby car in the app and pay per hour plus per kilometer.
This is the one we personally use the most because they usually have cars available a few minutes away.

- [Greenwheels](https://www.greenwheels.nl/en-us)
and [Free2Move](https://www.free2move.com/nl/en/car-sharing/amsterdam/)
are other popular car sharing solutions, but we haven't used them yet.

- [Diks Autoverhuur](https://diks.net/en)
and [Oscar](https://oscar.nl/en/locations/diemen)
are more classical, local, reputable car rental companies.
They might be better if you rent for multiple days or if you need a bigger car.
We've used Diks only, and only once.

Parking near us is free for 2 hours if you put a parking meter behind the windshield.
Longer parking requires a permit (except on Sundays), so contact us if you need that.
