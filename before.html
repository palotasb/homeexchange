<h1>Before you arrive – Emese & Boldi in Amsterdam</h1>

<main>

<h2>Weather</h2>
<p>
The weather in the Netherlands can be unpredictable and changes frequently,
so we recommend dressing in layers and packing a quality raincoat.
An umbrella isn't ideal due to the frequent wind and the crowds in the city center.
</p>

<h2>Explore Amsterdam Virtually</h2>
<p>
To get a feel for the city, consider downloading the Rick Steves Audio Europe app.
You'll find excellent podcasts covering Dutch history, society, and traditions,
as well as the unique polder system.
His free audio walking tours in Amsterdam are easy to follow and make exploring the city a breeze.
If you can't access the app, Spotify has similar content.
</p>

<h2>Day Trips By Car</h2>
<p>
Day Trips by Car: If you want to explore by car, MyWheels is super convenient.
Register before your trip, and when you're here, use the app to grab a car nearby.
But if you're just heading to another city, the train is quicker, cheaper, and hassle-free!
</p>

<h2>Navigating by Bike</h2>
<p>
If you prefer to get around by bike, we recommend using Organic Maps instead of Google Maps—    it provides better bike route information.
</p>
    
<h2>Traveling with little ones?</h2>
<p>
We don't have any equipment for little kids available.
We recommend checking out <a href="https://www.babonbo.com/en/search/amsterdam/NL">Babonbo</a>
for renting strollers, toys, or any other essentials you may need during your stay.
