# Amsterdam recommendations

## Amsterdam city attractions

We've highlighted a few must-see attractions:

- **[Johan Cruyff ArenA](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RXhhByrCoTCXca6F7)**: Home to AFC Ajax, this stadium offers guided tours where you can explore the locker rooms, pitchside, and the Ajax Museum. It's a fun 1-2 hour experience!
- **[Van Gogh Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ivfEeWLJd3FYwZLQ8)**: Top recommendation, but book weeks in advance and go early to beat the crowds.
- **[Rijksmuseum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cmXJSvo8Rf2uxUyU7)**: Home to Dutch masterpieces, like paintings from Rembrandt and Vermeer. It is huge, so we suggest focusing on specific exhibitions that interest you most, as seeing everything in one visit is nearly impossible.
- **[Rembrandt House Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GQRuckByNkFTj7nv6)**: This museum is dedicated to the life and work of the Dutch painter Rembrandt van Rijn.
- **[Anne Frank House](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MXSZAZJkJUbSuZjw6)**: If you are interested in the story, we can recommend it. Be sure to book tickets weeks in advance, though we think there are other museums in Amsterdam that offer more engaging experiences.
- **[Albert Cuyp Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XxZYqu29n9R3dFix8)**: It's touristy, but great for street food. Try local food like herring, stroopwafels and poffertjes (mini pancakes).
- **[Houseboat Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FyJz8DHKfcb5cmDy5)**: Experience Amsterdam's iconic canal lifestyle in this museum inside a real houseboat.
- **[This is Holland](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FZ37HuQPZqqrGqbq5)**: This 5D experience takes you on a virtual flight over the Netherlands, showcasing the country's stunning landscapes and landmarks.
- **[Royal Palace of Amsterdam](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DXqsQre3whtknmLb8)**: Originally a city hall, this 17th-century palace on Dam Square is a masterpiece of Dutch Golden Age architecture. It's a lovely two-hour visit.
- **[Stedelijk Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ws6cTGJnk9ffPZuA8)**: Museum for modern-, contemporary art, and design.
- **[Maritime Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JSLTRZ2EPsgakWyn9)**: Netherlands' seafaring past with interactive exhibits and historic ship displays.
- **[Verzetsmuseum (Resistance Museum)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/f31W6QiQ7z97AQUCA)**: It tells the story of the Dutch resistance during WWII. Through personal accounts, artifacts, and immersive displays.
- **Neighborhoods**: [Jordaan](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6w67LvfjsEo1JcNDA), [De Pijp](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nSy54dCUCGzC2W6q8), [Vondelpark](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1Az2KM4mR2powcYk7), and the [Red Light District](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1HjD6QFU24Wgp4EHA) are best seen on foot. Visit the Red Light District early in the day for beautiful, crowd-free views; its architecture is truly fascinating!
- **Canal Tour**: We also recommend discovering Amsterdam via a canal tour: we prefer choosing smaller boats, usually from [Airbnb Experiences](https://www.airbnb.com/amsterdam-netherlands/things-to-do).
