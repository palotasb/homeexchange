<h1>Amsterdam city tips</h1>

<main>

<h2>General tips</h2>
<p>
Amsterdam bikers can be a bit crazy!
If you don't feel comfortable biking in the city,
you can easily take the metro to the city center—it's only a 25-minute ride.
</p>

<h2>Amsterdam city attractions</h2>
<p>We've highlighted a few must-see attractions:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ivfEeWLJd3FYwZLQ8" target="_blank">Van Gogh Museum</a></strong>: Top recommendation, but book weeks in advance and go early to beat the crowds.
</li>
<li>
<strong><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/cmXJSvo8Rf2uxUyU7" target="_blank">Rijksmuseum</a></strong>: Home to Dutch masterpieces, like paintings from Rembrandt and Vermeer. It is huge, so we 
suggest focusing on specific exhibitions that interest you most, as seeing everything in one visit is nearly impossible.
</li>
<li>
<strong><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/GQRuckByNkFTj7nv6" target="_blank">Rembrandt House Museum</a></strong>:
This museum is dedicated to the life and work of the Dutch painter Rembrandt van Rijn.
