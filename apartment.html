<h1>Our Apartment</h1>

<p>We hope you feel completely at home! Here are a few tips to make things extra comfortable:</p>

<h2>🧑‍🍳 Kitchen and pantry 🍳</h2>

<h3>🍴 Kitchenware 🥛</h3>
<p>
All kitchen items are in the pantry, and you're welcome to use everything.
Just one request: please avoid putting any Teflon and wooden items in the dishwasher.
</p>

<h3>🍞 Foodstuff 🍯</h3>
<p>
Feel free to enjoy our coffee, tea, and rice and other basic ingredients.
Just make yourself at home!
</p>

<h3>🗑️ Trash ♻️</h3>
<p>
Please collect communal trash separately from recyclable plastic and paper.
Please take out the trash, plastic, and paper to the container in front of the building.
</p>

<h2>🧺 Laundry 🧢</h2>
<h3>👕 Washing clothes 👖</h3>
<p>
Laundry Supplies: Detergents and drying racks are in the pantry.
Leave the washing machine door and detergent drawer open after use,
and skip fabric softener (use a splash of vinegar instead).
</p>

<h2>🚿 Bathroom and toilet 🚽</h2>
<p>Bathroom Drain:  If it clogs, lift the rack and clear any hair.</p>
<p>Toilet: Finding the light switch and turning on the tap is tricky. We know, sorry!</p>
<ul>
<li>💡 Light switch: Inside, on the right, above the shelf.</li>
<li>🚰 Tap/faucet: Twist the end of the tap itself.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🚴‍♀️ Bicycles 🚴‍♂️</h2>
<p>
Feel free to use our bikes!
Just remember to bring them back up to the apartment afterward,
as there's a tendency for bikes to “disappear” in the Netherlands. 😄
</p>

<h2>🚭 No smoking 🚭</h2>

<p>Smoking is not allowed.</p>
